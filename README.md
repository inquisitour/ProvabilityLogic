# Paper 1: "The Interface Theorem"

Core Focus:
1. Undecidability as necessary consequence
2. Interface structure between truth and provability
3. Both semantic and syntactic proofs
4. Extension to higher-order logics

Main Result:
- Shows WHY undecidability must exist
- Proves it's a feature, not a bug
- System can prove its own undecidability

# Paper 2: "Beyond Gödel: Self-Proof of Consistency via Interface Structure"

Core Focus:
1. Using Interface Theorem's machinery
2. Showing how understanding necessity enables self-proof
3. Transcending Gödel's Second Theorem

Main Result:
- Systems can prove their own consistency
- Through understanding necessity of undecidability
- Via interface structure

# Benefits of Two Papers:

1. Logical Flow:
   - First establishes interface framework
   - Second shows revolutionary implication

2. Impact:
   - First paper: fundamental result
   - Second paper: revolutionary consequence

3. Historical Parallel:
   - Like Gödel's two theorems
   - Each profound in its own right
   - Together change understanding
